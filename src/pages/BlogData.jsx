      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        A well-designed office isn’t just about aesthetics—it directly impacts employee productivity, engagement, and overall job satisfaction. Whether you’re setting up a new office or revamping an existing one, here’s a step-by-step guide to designing a workspace that boosts efficiency.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">1. Define Your Office Layout</span>
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Before you start, understand your company’s needs. Do you need open workspaces, private cabins, or a mix of both? An ideal office layout promotes seamless collaboration while providing quiet zones for deep work.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">2. Invest in Ergonomic Furniture</span>
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Uncomfortable chairs and poor desk setups lead to posture issues and reduced efficiency. Choose ergonomic chairs, adjustable desks, and proper lighting to ensure employee comfort.

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">3. Optimize Lighting for Better Focus</span>
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Natural light boosts mood and productivity. If possible, position workstations near windows. For artificial lighting, use LED fixtures with adjustable brightness to reduce eye strain.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">4. Create Collaborative & Breakout Spaces</span>
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Incorporate areas where teams can brainstorm and collaborate. Meeting pods, informal lounges, and quiet zones help employees recharge and be more creative.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">5. Use Colors Strategically</span>
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Colors impact emotions. Blue enhances focus, green boosts creativity, and neutral tones create a calm atmosphere. Use colors that align with your company’s culture and work environment.

      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Your office space is more than just a place to work—it influences mood, motivation, and overall productivity. A well-designed workspace can enhance focus, reduce stress, and foster collaboration, while a poorly planned office can lead to distractions, fatigue, and disengagement. Here’s how office design directly impacts employee well-being and performance.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">1. Ergonomics: Comfort Equals Efficiency</span>
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        A comfortable workspace is key to sustained productivity. Investing in ergonomic chairs, height-adjustable desks, and proper screen positioning helps prevent fatigue, back pain, and eye strain, allowing employees to focus better.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">2. The Role of Natural Light & Air Quality</span>
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Harsh fluorescent lights can cause headaches and reduce concentration. Offices with ample natural light help regulate circadian rhythms, improve sleep quality, and enhance mood. Similarly, good ventilation and air purifiers can boost cognitive function and reduce sick days.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">3. Flexible Workspaces for a Dynamic Workforce</span>
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        A mix of open work areas, private cabins, quiet zones, and collaboration hubs ensures employees have the right environment for different tasks. Teams can brainstorm in creative zones while individuals can focus in distraction-free spaces.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">4. The Psychological Impact of Colors & Aesthetics</span>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Colors influence emotions. Blue tones boost concentration, green enhances creativity, and neutral colors promote calmness. Thoughtfully designed aesthetics can make a workplace feel more inspiring and engaging.
